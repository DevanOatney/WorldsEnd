A0|1|Callan||Wow! This place is amazing!||A1
A1|1|Briol||Huh...yeah. Where did that boar get to? We were right behind it.||A2
A2|1|Callan||It's Perfect! Don't you see Briol?!? This is what we've Been looking for!||A3
A3|1|Briol||What do you mean 'What we've been looking for?' We've barely left town.||A4
A4|1|Callan||But look at the size of this place! We could definately start a guild here! I'm going in!||A5
A5|1|Briol||Callan wait! It's dangerous! This whole place is over run with boars. There is probably a nest inside...with an alpha boar...yeah...I'm not letting you have all the fun!||A6

B0|1|Callan||See? I told you we could do this.||B1
B1|1|Briol||Alright, you win. This place is perfect, especially now that the boar problem is gone.||B2
B2|1|Callan||So...Where do we go from here?||B3
B3|1|Briol||We're going to need someone to train the hunters we recruit. I heard of an old Knight that is looking to take on apprentices that would be a perfect opertunity for him.||B4
B4|1|Callan||Oh, yeah. I heard of a retired hunter that is bored in retirement and looking to train new hunters in the old ways.||B5
B5|1|Briol||So, who should we go see?||B6
B6|2||2|Definately the Hunter! It was my idea and makes the most sense.|B7|You know, I think a strong knights skill could be useful in hunting. Let's go there!|B15
B7|1|Briol||Alright, let's go see this hunter of yours. Lead the way!||B8
B8|1|Callan||What?!? I don't know where he's at!||B9
B9|1|Briol||You're hopeless.  What would you do without me? I know of the hunter you are talking about. He lives to the South-East of here in a large lake town past the mountains.||B10
B10|1|Callan||If you knew, why did you ask?!?||B11
B11|1|Briol||I was trying to see if you had any leadership drive. I guess I was wrong and will be the leader from here on out.||B12
B12|1|Callan||That not fair!||B13
B13|1|Briol||Quit yer bitchin' and come on!||B14
B14|1|Callan||Fine! *grumble* *grumble*|B20
B15|1|Briol||Yeah! The knight lives near the ocean to the South-West in a little hamlet. Shouldn't take too long to get there.||B16
B16|1|Callan||I'll lead the way!||B17
B17|1|Briol||But you don't know the way...||B18
B18|1|Callan||I'll make it up as a go. That what good leaders do!||B19
B19|1|Briol||I don't think that's right, but whatever. Lead the way.||B20
