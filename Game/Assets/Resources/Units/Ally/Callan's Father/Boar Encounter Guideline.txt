At the end of the grave dialogue for Callan's father I want there to be an encounter. A boar moves out from the bush. It will charge the kids starting combat. If possible i'd like to do an overlay dialogue text with the father. Teaching them as to what everything in the combat menu does. From attacking to using items(i.e. healing items). Running and defending if those are possible as well.
