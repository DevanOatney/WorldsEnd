A1|1|Father||Ah, son, you finally made it. I was almost beginning to wonder if you had chosen to cower beneath the covers all day. Hahahah! But I'm glad that you found the gall to get up and follow after your sister and I. She has been raring to go! I could barely keep her from running off without you. I didn't want to have to explain myself twice though. So, let's continue on.|0|A2
A2|1|Narrator||Well, doesn't he have high hopes for you.|0|A3
A3|2|1|1|Callan|Ofcourse he does! He's my father. I just overslept, that's all.|A4
A4|1|Father||What are you going on about?|0|A5
A5|1|Sister||I always knew there was something weird about you.|0|A6
A6|2|1|2|Did you not hear that voice just now?|A7|It's nothing, forget I said anything.|A8
A7|1|Sister||Only the sound of your embarassment.|0|A8
A8|1|Father||Continuing on, I brought the two of you out here to seek your mother's blessing on the journey that lies ahead of you. It will most certainly be filled with many dangers. Not just in the form of the monsters that lie in wait to prey on you. Sometimes they take the form of a human and seek to deceive you. Be careful who you choose to trust, because not everyone carries the same pride in our word as we do. But you can trust each other. The world is big, so don't feel that you must go it alone.|0|A9
A9|1|Sister||You brought us out to mom's grave to tell us that?|0|A10|
A10|1|Father||No...We are here to ask for her to watch over you two as you go out into the world...and to also tell you of the true circumstances of your Mother's passing. Such a beautiful woman, whose life was cut far too short...I loved her with all my heart...and she loved you two as well. Enough to give her life to protect you two. Many years ago, when the village had first come to be, it was plagued with the constant abuse of bandits. They would come and take everything that their greedy hands could hold. One day, I had come across Inon. Such a beautiful village, not just because that's how I met your mother, but the people too. Two weeks before I showed up, they were ransacked. Taken for everything. I stayed to help rebuild the village and get it on it's feet again. I wasn't expecting to fall in love with not only your mother, but the people of Inon. I have never experienced such kindness before. Even with nothing, they were willing to give what little they had left. I agreed to stay and rid them of the bandits. So, I waited for them to return and I dealt them a lethal blow. A handful scurried away in fear. I had hoped that would have been enough to keep them at bay. And it was. Many years passed, the two of you came along, and I felt like I had come to the end of my journey. I felt that I could live here the rest of my life with your Mother and you two without worry... But I was wrong. Many summers ago in the dead of night, when you two were still very much young, the village was attacked. It was the bandits, back for vengeance. I grabbed my sword and shield, charging headlong into them. I could feel the weight of Inon on my shoulders. I couldn't fail, I had a home to protect. I struck down bandit after bandit, but there were many. More than I could count. They surrounded me. I couldn't go anywhere without having to strike down a foe and have two more take its place. What comes next still haunts me in my dream til this day...A scream came from our house, I feared the worst. Anger and fury spilt out from me, I charged headlong into the bandits. Laying waste to every single one...leaving devastation in my wake...but...I was too late...Your mother was lying on the floor, badly hurt. The dead body of a bandit lie off to the side. She was hurt really bad. I sat beside her. Holding her close to me, feeling her breathing becoming more shallow. There wasn't anything I could do. She died protecting the two of you...She loved the both of you so dearly and so do I...|0|A11
A11|1|Sister||*sobbing quietly*...I had no idea..|0|A12|
A12|2|3|3|Dad...|A13|*sob quietly* You should have told us this a long time ago!|A13|....|A13
A13|1|Father||I know I should have told the both of you many years ago. But I felt that you were too young. You know now, and that's what is important. When you go down whatever path you may choose, remember that not every soul is a good one.|0|A14
A14|1|Sister||We will father!|0|A15
A15|1|Father||Good, that's what I like to hear. But before you go, I want to refresh your memory on how combat works. Ah, here comes your first lessson.|0|A16

B1|1|Father||I'm proud of the both of you. It fills me with joy to see you growing up. Faster than I would have liked, but such is life. The two of you are following a long line of tradition that has been passed down for generations. It is your turn to go out now; to start a guild, or die trying.|0|B2
B2|2|3|3|I'm not sure how I feel about the dying part...|B3|It's pretty dangerous out there, I think I'll pass on this tradition.|B3|If you feel we're ready, then let's do it!|B4
B3|1|Father||Too bad. Either way you might die. You stay here, you die most certainly... not that I'm suggesting I would do it....but..at least if you venture out, there is the possibility you might live. Plus you have each other!|0|B5
B4|1|Father||That's some courage you got there! It looks like you might have inherited something from me after all.|0|B5
B5|1|Father||Collect your trophy from the beast. A tusk will be sufficient. It will mark the start of the family tradition. Carry it with you as you go along your journey. It will remind you of your sense of honor and tradition. I still have the bear paw from when I was about your age and went headlong to start a hunter's guild. But that is another story for another time. Go get your spoils of victory.|0|B6

C1|1|Father||Ah, it's good to see how much you two have grown! Some sisters more than others. But I'm still very proud to see all our hard work preparing for today to have paid off. You are ready to go off and fulfill our family tradition. You will bring into this world a guild unlike any other in times like these. Some of the mystics in nearby towns have foretold that the prophecy of rebirth is late to come and that soon it will come. Breathing new life into these lands, as vague as that is. Some say that it will completely destroy life, others say that it will bring untold wealth and happiness. I suppose that it is up to you to decide which it shall be, because until that day comes, only Iluyani will know. Oh, and you too Callan, you will do alright. Get out there and change the world dear...and you too Callan.|0|C2
