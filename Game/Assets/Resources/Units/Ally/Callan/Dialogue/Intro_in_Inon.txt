A6|1|The Narrator|Sounds/Voice/The Narrator/The_Narrator_Intro_Line_4|Of course you would... Let's get on with the show. Your dad left you a note on the desk over there. Now that you've shown to me that you can perform menial tasks and follow simple directions, go ahead and take a look at it. To read the note, which I pray to Illuyani you know how to read, press the E key. This will allow you to interact with the world around you, for the most part.|1|A15
