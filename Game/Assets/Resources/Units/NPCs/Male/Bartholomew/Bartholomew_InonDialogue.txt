A4|1|Bartholomew||My boy, Marcus, who works out on the farms to the south may be as dense as his father is when it comes to the affairs of the heart. I don't want to intervene, so I'll let him figure it out. I got lucky myself and was graced with such a wonderful wife who made it clear that she was smitten with me. Maybe my boy will find himself in a similar situation...|0|A5
