B0|1|Briar|Sounds/Voice/Briar/Briar_Line_2|Hey Callan! Your father and sister were just here. They were headed out to the lake. I presume to see your mother and ask for her blessing before you two kids head off on your journey, but you aren't a kid anymore are you? Come back soon and I should have new wares to help a stout young lad such as yourself on your journey.|1|A2
