A1|1|Briar|Hey Callan! Your father and sister were just here. They were headed out to the lake. I presume to see your mother and ask for her blessing before you two kids head off on your journey. But you aren't a kid anymore are you? Come back soon and I should have new wares to help a stout young lad such as yourself on your journey.|
