A1|1|Father|I'm proud of the both of you. It fills me with joy to see you growing up. Faster than I would have liked, but such is life. The two of you are following a long line of tradition that has been passed down for generations. It is your turn to go out now; to start a guild, or die trying.|A2
A2|2|3|3|I'm not sure how I feel about the dying part...|A3|It's pretty dangerous out there, I think I'll pass on this tradition.|A3|If you feel we're ready, then let's do it!|A4
A3|1|Father|Too bad. Either way you might die. You stay here, you die most certainly... not that I'm suggesting I would do it....but..at least if you venture out, there is the possibility you might live. Plus you have each other!|A5
A4|1|Father|That's some courage you got there! It looks like you might have inherited something from me after all.|A5
A5|1|Father|Collect your trophy from the beast. A tusk will be sufficient. It will mark the start of the family tradition. Carry it with you as you go along your journey. It will remind you of your sense of honor and tradition. I still have the bear paw from when I was about your age and went headlong to start a hunter's guild. But that is another story for another time. Go get your spoils of victory.
