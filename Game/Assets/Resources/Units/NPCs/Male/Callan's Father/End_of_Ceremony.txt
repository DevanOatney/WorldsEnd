A1|1|Father|Ah, it's good to see how much you two have grown! Some sisters more than others. But I'm still very proud to see all our hard work preparing for today to have paid off. You are ready to go off and fulfill our family tradition. You will bring into this world a guild unlike any other in times like these. Some of the mystics in nearby towns have foretold that the prophecy of rebirth is late to come and that soon it will come. Breathing new life into these lands, as vague as that is. Some say that it will completely destroy life, others say that it will bring untold wealth and happiness. I suppose that it is up to you to decide which it shall be, because until that day comes, only Iluyani will know. Oh, and you too Callan, you will do alright. Get out there and change the world dear...and you too Callan.
