The Roster screen is only available within your castle after a certain point in the story. Before then and while not within the castle, the tab is greyed out.
After clicking on the roster tab, using the mouse: the screen changes to the roster screen. Floating the mouse over a character brings up a floating box with the characters stats identical to the status screen one.
To add them to your party, drag and drop them into the desired position and the two will switch. If a character from the active area is drug into the active, the character isn't replaced, just removed.
Whenever a character os being drug within the inactive box it looks like the character boxes in the list. As soon as they are out of the inactive box, they become a sprite of the character.
When using the keyboard: When the Tab is clicked, the screen appears and the first character in the inactive list is highlighted. When you click a character in the Inactive side, the Top front character is then highlighted.
Clicking on a caracter on the active side then switches the two characters. if you want ot just remove a character from the party, after selecting ht eroster tab, but before clicking on an inactive character, 
if you click the left arrow key, the highlighter moves to the active side. clicking on an active character removes the character and moves the highlighter back to the inactive side.
