Briol: "I always knew there was something weird about you." *reacting to the main character talking to himself*
Briol: "Only the sound of your embarassment." *in response to not hearing the voice of the narrator that only the main caracter can hear*
Briol: "You brought us out to mom's grave to tell us that?" *after Matach just told her, essentially, not to trust anyone*

Briol: "We will father!" *coming back from almost crying with renewed enthusiasm to starting a new adveture*
